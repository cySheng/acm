This script can be run on Heroku using CRON and will automatically create and manage a wildcard SSL certificate issued by LetsEncrypt. If you're running a Heroku application with dynamic subdomains this is a great way to get a free SSL cert. Found this useful? Considering [sponsoring our open source](https://github.com/sponsors/outline).

## Deployment

Deploy to Heroku and set up the schedule to look like this:

Ensure all environment variables in cert.sh are set in the environment:

- `DOMAIN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`
- `HEROKU_API_KEY`
- `HEROKU_APP`
